	desc = "Dragonborn are a proud and ancient race that trace their heritage to dragons of old. \
	They are highly protective of their bloodline and do everything in their power to make sure it does not spread beyond their own, \
	as they believe themselves to be guardians of tradition and that it is their ultimate duty to maintain their prestige as a race. \
	After all, a single drop of draconic blood in ones bloodline means that they will experience all of the benefits of having draconic ancestors such as agelessness.\
	<br><br> \
	Yet, it comes at a cost. \
	While initially viewed as one of the noblest races, \
	they are now hated for their insufferable arrogance and often appear completely out of touch with the rest of society. \
	Their inability to have a concept of time, refusal to compromise or intermarry, \
	along with their rejection of any technology that threatens their supremacy have earned them countless enemies from Axians to Dwarves. \
	For instance, they view any Wild-kin with draconic features or blood as inherently inferior. \
	Yet, not all Dragonborn are like this with some believing it is their duty to help lesser races, although many still view these Dragonborn to be just as insufferable.\
	<br><br> \
	In the past, Dragonborn held positions of power and prestige across all the realms. \
	Many try to style themselves after knight-philosophers in an attempt to hide their brutish ways. \
	When in reality, most Dragonborn are known for being bloody conquerors. \
	However, the rise of humans have caused their ambitions to crumble, forcing them to work with other races, especially at the climax of the Great Lizard Uprising. \
	Furthermore, dwindling numbers have caused Dragonborn to increasingly abandon the ways of old, forcing them to adapt to a more modern way of life."
