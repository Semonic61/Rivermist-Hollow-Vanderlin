/*
 * Reflections.
 *
 * One gate, one appearance, two ways of drawing the result. Whether something casts a reflection is
 * answered in exactly one place - casts_reflection() - and both backends ask that and nothing else.
 *
 * REFLECTION_BACKEND_STENCIL: the subject carries a flipped copy of itself on REFLECTION_PLANE, and
 * reflective surfaces punch a hole for it with a REFLECTIVE_DISPLACEMENT_PLANE mask. Costs a surface
 * nothing at all - the subject pays for its own copy - which is why every water tile on the map can
 * afford it. Entry point is make_shiny() below.
 *
 * REFLECTION_BACKEND_OBJECT: the surface tracks the movables near it and owns a real reflection atom
 * per subject, so the reflection is a thing you can address, transform and eventually walk into. Costs
 * a component plus an object per pair, so it only suits a handful of surfaces. See
 * /datum/component/reflection, worn by mirrors.
 *
 * A stencil surface can be promoted to the object backend by giving it the component instead; the gate
 * and the subject-side appearance are shared either way.
