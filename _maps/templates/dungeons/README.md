# Dungeon Mapping Guide

How to make content for the dungeon system — both **one-shot dungeons** (open from an
overworld entrance, clear it, loot it, leave, it collapses) and **infinite dungeons**
(endless branching delves with floors, bosses, break rooms, and a meta-progression).

You do two things to add content:

1. **Draw a room** as a `.dmm` map template in `_maps/templates/dungeons/<theme>/`.
2. **Register it** as a `/datum/map_template/pocket/dungeon` subtype in `code/modules/dungeons/dungeon_template.dm`.

**Folder convention: one folder per theme/set, `<kind>_<name>.dmm` inside it.** Rooms in a
theme are authored and re-skinned together, so they live together; the room kind goes in the
filename prefix (`break_`, `combat_`, `boss_`, `descent_`, `oneshot_`). Harness fixtures live in
`_test/` — never put content there. **`swampgob/` (The Sunken Warrens) is the starter reference
set**: seven rooms + floor configs, showing every marker in real use, including a key-locked
treasure gate wired to a keyholder (see `combat_gobwarren.dmm`). **`drow/` (Drow Dungeon) is the
deeper production set**: one break room, one descent, one boss room, and six combat rooms used by
floors 3–5 of the generic infinite delve.

Everything else (loading, collapsing, mob tracking, loot, currency, party logic) is automatic.

### Shipped standalone singlets

The original 15x15 RMH small-room set remains in
`_maps/templates/rmh/randomlocs/small/` and is registered in place. Each room has its own
theme-filtered entrance subtype, while the entrance still rolls by theme rather than hard-locking
one template. Adding another room to the same theme and tier automatically gives that entrance
cooldown-to-cooldown variety.

| Interior | Template id | Entrance subtype | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soot-Stained Hideout | `singlet_bandit_hideout` | `/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance/bandit_hideout` | 2 |
| Bloodmoss Den | `singlet_bear_den` | `/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance/bear_den` | 3 |
| Gnawcamp | `singlet_ratfolk_camp` | `/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance/ratfolk_camp` | 2 |
| Silk-Choked Nursery | `singlet_spider_nursery` | `/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance/spider_nursery` | 1 |
| Moon-Riven Shrine | `singlet_werewolf_shrine` | `/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance/werewolf_shrine` | 3 |
| Bone-Littered Den | `singlet_wolf_den` | `/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance/wolf_den` | 1 |

Place the matching entrance subtype on an overworld map or exterior random-location template. Do
not use the unfiltered base entrance for authored content: its broad fallback is intended for
debugging and mapper experimentation.

## 1. The golden rules

- **Every dungeon room turf must use the area `/area/pocket_dimension/dungeon`.** Not a normal
  area. The system finds the room by its turfs; the wrong area breaks lighting, collapse, and ejection.
- **Wall the room in.** The loader seals a 1-tile padding ring around your room with an
  indestructible boundary, but your room should still have its own outer walls
  (`/turf/closed/wall/mineral/wood`, mineral walls, whatever fits the theme).
- **Keep rooms reasonably small** (the test maps are 7×7). Big rooms cost more reserved space.
  Width/height are read automatically from the `.dmm` — you don't declare them.
- **Place landmarks, not hardcoded structures**, for anything the system manages (entries,
  exits, gates, guardians, loot, shrines). Landmarks are invisible markers that the loader
  replaces with the real thing at load time.
- **Native mobs die with the room.** Hostile mobs you map in (or spawn from guardian markers)
  are deleted when the dungeon collapses — they never spill onto the overworld. Players, pets,
  and dropped items are ejected safely.

---

## 2. Landmarks reference

All are placed in the map editor like any `/obj/effect/landmark`. They are invisible in-game.

### Core (from the pocket-dimension base — every room needs these where noted)

| Landmark | Purpose | Required in |
|---|---|---|
| `/obj/effect/landmark/pocket_dimension/entry` | Where mobs arrive when they enter/are dropped in | **Every room** (falls back to room center if missing) |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/pocket_dimension/exit` | Becomes the return seam back to the overworld | One-shot rooms and break rooms. In a run, **only break rooms** get a working seam — the loader strips it from every other kind (combat/boss/descent) |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/pocket_dimension/drop_spot` | Preferred tile where shoved/dragged-in things land | Optional |

### Dungeon-specific

| Landmark | Becomes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/guardian` | A hostile mob from `mob_pool` | Set `mob_pool` (weighted list), `spawn_chance`, `force_elite`. Dying guardians are tracked; room "clears" when all are dead |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/guardian/boss` | A floor boss | Pulls from the run's **floor config** boss pool by default (`use_floor_boss_pool = TRUE`), or its own `mob_pool` if FALSE. Boss death opens the way to the floor's break room |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/guardian/keyholder` | A guardian that drops a `dungeon_key` on death | Set `key_id` to match a key-locked gate in the same room |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/loot` | A sealed reward cache | Unlocks when the room is cleared. Uses the template's `loot_table_type` |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/gate` | A forward passage to the next room | Default `path_type = combat`. See gate variants below |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/gate/back` | The way back to the previous room | Put one in every combat/boss room so the party can retreat |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/gate/treasure` | Forward gate biased to a low-danger, high-reward room | |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/gate/elite` | Forward gate biased to a champion (elite) room | |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/gate/hazard` | Forward gate biased to a harder, richer room | |
| `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/shrine` | A break-room vendor (spend motes on heals/boons/caches/banking) | Break/descent rooms only |

**Guardian markers spawn from a weighted list.** Example, set on the marker instance in the map editor's variable edit, or as a subtype in code:

```dm
/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/guardian/my_wolves
	mob_pool = list(/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/retaliate/wolf = 10, /mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/retaliate/bear = 2)
```

**Gate variants** only change which kind of room they roll toward and the danger/reward shown
on examine. A forward gate stays **sealed until the room is cleared**; back gates are always open.

**Key-locked gates:** set `requires_key = TRUE` and a `key_id` on a gate marker, then place a
`/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/guardian/keyholder` with the same `key_id` in that room. Players
must kill the keyholder, grab the dropped key, and apply it to the gate.

You can also drop a plain `/obj/effect/spawner/map_spawner` in a room for cosmetic/loot variety —
it rolls at load time like anywhere else in the game.

---

## 3. Registering a room template

Add a subtype to `code/modules/dungeons/dungeon_template.dm`. The base sets sane defaults
(collapse lifecycle, idle timeout, the dungeon instance type) — you only set what differs.

```dm
/datum/map_template/pocket/dungeon/wolf_den
	name = "Wolf Den"
	id = "dungeon_wolf_den"                                  // unique, referenced by id
	mappath = "_maps/templates/dungeons/wolf_den.dmm"
	theme = DUNGEON_THEME_WOLF
	room_kind = DUNGEON_ROOM_ONESHOT
	difficulty_tier = 1
	dungeon_weight = 10                                      // pick weight within its pool
	loot_table_type = /datum/loot_table/mining_cache         // used by loot caches
	gate_hint = "You smell wet fur and old blood."           // shown on gates that lead here
```

Templates auto-register at init (every `/datum/map_template/pocket/dungeon` subtype is loaded),
so no list to edit. Resolve one in code by `id` via `SSpocket_dimensions.resolve_template("dungeon_wolf_den")`.

### Template fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` / `id` | Display name and unique id (id is how everything references it) |
| `mappath` | Path to the `.dmm` |
| `theme` | `DUNGEON_THEME_*` — see `code/__DEFINES/dungeons.dm` for the current production and test themes |
| `room_kind` | `DUNGEON_ROOM_*` — `ONESHOT`, `COMBAT`, `BREAK`, `BOSS`, `DESCENT` |
| `production_eligible` | Keep TRUE for shipped rooms. Test fixtures set this FALSE and broad production pools cannot select them |
| `difficulty_tier` | 1–5+; how dangerous. Infinite runs pick templates in a tier band around the current floor |
| `dungeon_weight` | Relative pick weight inside its filtered pool |
| `loot_table_type` | A `/datum/loot_table` subtype the room's caches roll from |
| `gate_hint` | Flavor line shown when examining a gate that leads to this template |

---

## 4. Room kinds — what each needs

### `ONESHOT` — a one-bite dungeon
Self-contained. Player enters, clears guardians, loots, leaves via the exit seam, it collapses.
- ✅ `entry` landmark
- ✅ `exit` landmark (the return seam)
- ✅ one or more `guardian` markers (mapped-in simple-animal hostiles are also discovered automatically; carbon/NPC guardians require a marker)
- ✅ one or more `loot` markers
- ❌ no gates needed

### `BREAK` — a safe room (infinite dungeon)
The only place players can leave an infinite run, and where they regroup. In the
floor loop it sits **after the boss**: descent landing → combat stretch → boss →
break room (the exit) → descent → next floor.
- ✅ `entry` landmark
- ✅ `exit` landmark (overworld return — the run's only working exits)
- ✅ **2–3 forward `gate` markers** (the branching choice). Mix variants for risk/reward
- ✅ optional `shrine` marker
- ❌ no guardians (break rooms auto-clear)

### `COMBAT` — a fight room (infinite dungeon)
- ✅ `entry` landmark
- ✅ a `gate/back` marker (retreat)
- ✅ **1+ forward `gate` markers** (sealed until cleared)
- ✅ guardians (and optional `loot`, `keyholder` + key-locked gate)
- ❌ **no exit landmark** — combat rooms intentionally have no overworld exit; the loader strips
  any fallback. Players leave a stretch only by reaching a break room

### `BOSS` — caps a floor (infinite dungeon)
- ✅ `entry` landmark
- ✅ a `gate/back` marker
- ✅ a `guardian/boss` marker
- ✅ **one forward `gate`** — when the boss dies it opens onto the floor's **break room**
- ✅ optional `loot`
- ❌ no exit landmark

### `DESCENT` — a floor's landing
The room a run **starts in**, and the room beyond every post-boss break room.
Crossing into one raises the floor and despawns everything behind you. Lay it
out like a break room (entry + forward gates, optional shrine) — an `exit`
landmark is tolerated but stripped (no overworld return from a landing). The
starter build reuses the break-room layout for this.

---

## 5. One-shot dungeons end-to-end

1. Draw the room, area `/area/pocket_dimension/dungeon`, with `entry`, `exit`, guardian(s), loot.
2. Register a `/datum/map_template/pocket/dungeon` with `room_kind = DUNGEON_ROOM_ONESHOT`, a
   `theme`, a `difficulty_tier`, and a `loot_table_type`.
3. Place an entrance on the overworld map: `/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance`.
   - `theme_filter` — restrict to one theme (null = any one-shot template)
   - `tier_min` / `tier_max` — the danger band this location rolls from
   - `respawn_cooldown` — dormancy after the dungeon collapses before it re-rolls a fresh one

```dm
// In a map, or as a mapping subtype:
/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance/wolf_country
	theme_filter = DUNGEON_THEME_WOLF
	tier_min = 1
	tier_max = 2
```

Multiple one-shot templates sharing a theme/tier band give that entrance variety — each use
rolls a different one.

---

## 6. Infinite dungeons end-to-end

1. Make a set of rooms: at least one `BREAK`, several `COMBAT` (varied tiers), one `BOSS`, and a
   `DESCENT` room — all sharing a `theme`.
2. Register them as templates (one per `.dmm`), each with the right `room_kind` and `theme`.
3. Define a **floor config** in `code/modules/dungeons/dungeon_floors.dm`:

```dm
/datum/dungeon_floor_config/gnawed_hollows
	floor = 1
	floor_name = "The Gnawed Hollows"
	themes = list(DUNGEON_THEME_WOLF, DUNGEON_THEME_BANDIT)   // rooms pull from these
	tier = 1                                                  // base danger for this floor
	stretch_length = 5                                        // combat rooms before the boss/break
	boss_pool = list(/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/boss/dungeon/wolf_alpha = 10)
```

Floors are looked up by number; beyond the deepest defined floor the last config repeats with a
rising tier, so the dungeon is genuinely endless. Add configs for floors 1–5 (`DUNGEON_MAX_DESIGNED_FLOOR`)
to hand-author the early game.

4. Place an **infinite** entrance on the overworld: `/obj/structure/dungeon_entrance/infinite`.
   Players alt-click it to open the **assemble-your-party** screen; the leader descends with the
   present party. Right-click opens the **Delver's Ledger** (spend echoes on unlocks/cosmetics).

---

## 7. Bosses

**Any `/mob/living` typepath in a floor's `boss_pool` becomes a boss.** When spawned, the system
promotes it via `make_dungeon_boss()`: floor-scaled stats, a dressed-up name + aura + bigger
sprite, a floating **healthbar** the whole room sees, and — for non-ATB mobs — a telegraphed
ability kit (lunge / ground-slam / enrage). So you can make a regular wolf or bandit into a floor
boss just by listing it:

```dm
/datum/dungeon_floor_config/gnawed_hollows
	boss_pool = list(/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/retaliate/wolf = 10)
```

For a **hand-crafted** boss with the full ATB ability economy, still make a
`/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/boss/dungeon` subtype (its bespoke abilities are kept; it also
gets the generic scaling + healthbar):

```dm
/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/boss/dungeon/wolf_alpha
	name = "Alpha of the Pack"
	maxHealth = 400
	health = 400
	melee_damage_lower = 18
	melee_damage_upper = 26
	mote_bounty = 250          // big mote drop on death (others scale by floor)
```

You never scale bosses by hand — `make_dungeon_boss()` does it at spawn. Give bespoke bosses ATB
abilities (`/datum/action/boss` subtypes); see `code/modules/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/bosses/`.

---

## 8. Loot

Reward caches use the template's `loot_table_type`, a `/datum/loot_table` subtype
(see `code/datums/components/loot_spawner/loot_tables/`). The cache rolls per looter and scales
with the run's floor (`delve_level`) and the looter's luck. Point deeper/rarer templates at richer
tables. The `extra_cache` meta-unlock gives owners one extra share per cache automatically.

---

## 8.5. Encounter director & randomization (infinite dungeons)

Combat rooms don't have to be hand-stuffed with fixed guardians. The director can fill them from
**per-floor mob pools**, scatter them randomly, enhance them, and slap a **room trait** on top.

**Floor mob pool.** Give a floor config a `combat_mob_pool` — a list of `/datum/dungeon_spawn_entry`,
each a mob path + weight + **combat style** + min tier:

```dm
/datum/dungeon_floor_config/gnawed_hollows/New()
	. = ..()
	combat_mob_pool = list(
		new /datum/dungeon_spawn_entry(/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/retaliate/wolf, 10, DUNGEON_STYLE_MELEE),
		new /datum/dungeon_spawn_entry(/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/retaliate/some_archer, 6, DUNGEON_STYLE_RANGED, 2),
	)
	density_min = 2
	density_max = 4
	enhance_chance = 25   // % per mob to get affixes
	elite_chance = 8      // % per mob to become a champion
```

Styles are `DUNGEON_STYLE_MELEE` / `_RANGED` / `_CASTER`. Room traits use them to filter (see below).

**Two markers feed the pool:**
- `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/guardian/random` — spawns one mob from the floor pool at this tile.
  Optional `style_filter` restricts it. (A plain `guardian` marker with an empty `mob_pool` also
  falls back to the floor pool.)
- `/obj/effect/landmark/dungeon/encounter` — requests a **scatter**: the director drops
  `density_min..density_max` mobs (scaled by party size) on random open floor tiles. Optional
  `density_override` and `style_filter`.

**Enhancement** happens automatically: deeper rooms enhance every guardian (affixes), and each mob
rolls `elite_chance` to become a named **Champion** with bonus affixes + aura + bigger mote drop.

**Room traits** are fully automatic — **mappers do nothing.** Each combat room has a 50% chance to
roll one trait that reshapes its encounter. Current set: **Emboldened** (stronger), **Enraged**
(faster), **Swarm** (more, weaker), **Treasure-laden** (bonus cache), **Archers' Roost** /
**Brute Hall** (only ranged / only melee — these use the style tags, so populate your pool with the
right styles). Add a trait by adding a `/datum/dungeon_room_trait` subtype — it auto-registers.

## 9. Quick checklists

**One-shot room:** dungeon area ✓ · walls ✓ · `entry` ✓ · `exit` ✓ · guardian(s) ✓ · `loot` ✓ · template registered (`ONESHOT`) ✓ · entrance placed ✓

**Combat room:** dungeon area ✓ · walls ✓ · `entry` ✓ · `gate/back` ✓ · forward `gate`(s) ✓ · guardian(s) ✓ · **no `exit`** ✓ · template registered (`COMBAT`) ✓

**Break room:** dungeon area ✓ · walls ✓ · `entry` ✓ · `exit` ✓ · 2–3 forward `gate`s ✓ · optional `shrine` ✓ · **no guardians** ✓ · template registered (`BREAK`) ✓

**Boss room:** dungeon area ✓ · walls ✓ · `entry` ✓ · `gate/back` ✓ · `guardian/boss` ✓ · one forward `gate` ✓ · **no `exit`** ✓ · template registered (`BOSS`) ✓ · boss added to a floor `boss_pool` ✓

---

## 10. Common mistakes

- **Wrong area** → room won't clear/collapse correctly. Always `/area/pocket_dimension/dungeon`.
- **Exit landmark in a combat/boss room** → it's stripped anyway; players think they can leave mid-fight. Don't place it.
- **Forward gate but no `entry` in the destination template** → mobs land on the room center (works, but place an `entry` for control).
- **Boss room with no forward gate** → no descent appears after the boss dies; the floor dead-ends.
- **Keyholder `key_id` doesn't match the gate's `key_id`** → the key won't fit; the vault is unreachable.
- **New theme/room-kind string not added to `code/__DEFINES/dungeons.dm`** → won't compile.
- **Template `id` collision** → templates are keyed by `id`; duplicates clobber each other.
